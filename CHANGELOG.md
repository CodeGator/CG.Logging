# CG.Logging change log
---

## 2021.2

* I switched to the .NET 5.0 framework

## 2021.1

* I copied the old CG.Logging project.

* I added AddLogging and UseLogging methods, to kick off the loader process, for logging.

* I added a sample application.

* I added a "do nothing" strategy, so the sample could load something.
